@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to perform
authenticated encryption and decryption using the AES GCM algorithm.

This example demonstrates two ways of using the cryptographic services:
1 - The single call method: algorithm configuration and execution is done via a single API call.
2 - The multiple calls method: algorithm configuration and execution is done in several API calls,
allowing in particular a piecemeal injection of data to process.

For each method, there are two examples provided:
a - An authenticated encryption of a known plaintext, followed by the verification of the generated ciphertext
b - An verified decryption of a known ciphertext, followed by the verification of the generated plaintext

In case of successful operations:
- the red led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the red led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WBxx devices.

  - This example has been tested with P-NUCLEO-WB55 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
