@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to hash a message
using the SHA256 algorithm.

This example demonstrates two ways of using the cryptographic services:
1 - The single call method: algorithm configuration and execution is done via a single API cal.
2 - The multiple calls method: algorithm configuration and execution is done in several API calls,
allowing in particular a piecemeal injection of data to process.

For each method, there is on example provided:
a - A hashing of a known message, followed by the verification of the generated digest

In case of successful operations:
- the red led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the red led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WBxx devices.

  - This example has been tested with P-NUCLEO-WB55 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
