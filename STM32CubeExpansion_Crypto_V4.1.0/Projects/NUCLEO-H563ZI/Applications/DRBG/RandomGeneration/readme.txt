@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to generate random numbers
using the DRBG module.

This example demonstrates the generation of random numbers based on known input entropy, nonce and personalization.
So that produced random can be compared to known random.

In case of successful operations:
- the red led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the red led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H5xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-H563ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
