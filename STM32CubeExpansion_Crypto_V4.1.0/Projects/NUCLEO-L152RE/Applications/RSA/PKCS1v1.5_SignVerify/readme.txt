@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to sign and verify
a message using the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 compliant algorithm.

This example demonstrates how to use the library services to perform RSA operation
in a single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation
is done in one single API call.

This example is schedule as follow:
Preliminary - Generate digest of the known message
a - The signature of the known message digest using the regular private key representation (modulus + exponent),
    so that generated signature can be compared to the known signature
b - The signature of the known message digest using the chinese remainder theorem (CRT) private key representation,
    so that generated signature can be compared to the known signature
c - The verification of the message digest with the known signature

In case of successful operations:
- the green led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED

@note This example uses the specific cmox_rsa_setKeyCRTwithFACM that allows to be protected
against the Bellcore attack. For more details on this attack, see https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/553.pdf

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L1xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32L152RE-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
