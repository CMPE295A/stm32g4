@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to sign and verify
a message using the EdDSA algorithm over Ed25519 curve.

This example demonstrates how to use the predefined curves parameters to perform
ECC operation in a single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation
is done in one single API call.

This example is schedule as follow:
a - The signature of the known message, so that generated signature can be compared
    to the known signature
b - The verification of the know message with the known signature

In case of successful operations:
- the green led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G4xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-G474RE RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
