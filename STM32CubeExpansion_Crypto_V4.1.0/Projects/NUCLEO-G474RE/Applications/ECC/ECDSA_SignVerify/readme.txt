@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to sign and verify
a message using the ECDSA algorithm over SECP256R1 curve.

This example demonstrates how to use the predefined curves parameters to perform
ECC operation in a single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation
is done in one single API call.

This example is schedule as follow:
Preliminary - Generate digest of the known message
a - The signature of the known message digest using a known random, so that generated
    signature can be compared to the known signature
b - The verification of the know message digest with the known signature
c - The signature of the known message digest using a true random
d - The verification of the know message digest with this newly generated signature

In case of successful operations:
- the green led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the green led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
