@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to establish
a shared secret using the ECDH algorithm over SECP256R1 curve.

This example demonstrates how to use the predefined curves parameters to perform
ECC operation in a single call method: the configuration of the algorithm, and the operation
is done in one single API call.

This example is schedule as follow:
a - Using known remote public key and known local private, establish the shared secret
b - Shared secret is composed of 2 coordinates X & Y. Compare the generated secret X coordinate with the expected one

In case of successful operations:
- the red led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the red led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WBAxx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-WBA52CG board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
