@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library to generate and verify
a message authentication code (MAC) of a plaintext using the KMAC algorithm.

This example demonstrates two ways of using the cryptographic services:
1 - The single call method: algorithm configuration and execution is done via a single API call.
2 - The multiple calls method: algorithm configuration and execution is done in several API calls,
allowing in particular a piecemeal injection of data to process.

For each method, there are two examples provided:
a - A generation of the MAC of a known message, followed by the verification of it.
b - A verification of the message using the given authentication tag.

In case of successful operations:
- the red led will be turned on
- the global variable glob_status will be set to PASSED
In case of failure:
- the red led will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.
- the global variable glob_status will be set to FAILED
